## Features
- It has six bars because I like rounded corners
  - Clicking on the CPU utilization brings up `btop`
  - Clicking on the wifi module brings up a wifi menu
  - Clicking on the time shows the date
  - You can change the weather module for a power menu in `polybar/config.ini`

- Music bar!
  - Powered by polybar-spotify (see Credits)
  - Shows a cool wave when idle
  - Control all media with `playerctl`

- Padoru brings you Arch updates
> For best immersion, alias paru to padoru

## Setup
Drop all files except `Extras` in `~/.config`.

`Extras` include:
- GTK icons and themes go to `~/.icons` and `~/.themes`. (Install lxappearance to change GTK theme if you're on a WM)
- Scripts under `bin` go to `~/.local/bin` by default. Don't forget to `chmod +x`.
- `vim-airline` contains color scheme for vim-airline, put it under `~/.vim/plugged/vim-airline-themes/autoload/airline/themes`
- `wal` contains `colors.json` for pywal
- `wallpaper`

You want to add these to your session startup script (`.xprofile` or `.xinitrc`)

- Media controls
`playerctld deamon &`
- Charger event notifications
`$HOME/.local/bin/chargernotif &`
- Weather module and notification
`ntfd &`

Adjust the position of the bars in `~/.config/polybar/config.ini`

## Keybinds
Basically just default sxhkd keybinds, so...
- `Super + space` for run launcher
- `Alt + tab` for, well, tab switcher
- `Super + enter` for kitty
- `printscrn` for flameshot
- Check `sxhkdrc` for more (it's mostly just default)
